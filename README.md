To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start <day> <optional:input-file>
```

By default, the input file used will be the `input.txt` file in the `day<day>` directory. If an argument is provided, it will look for a file which name starts with the provided argument in the `day<day>` directory.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
